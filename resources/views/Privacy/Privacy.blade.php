    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        Dine Chat may collect the following information from users of our application: first name, last name, street
        address, area and city, phone and contact numbers, email address, GPS location (mobile application)
        (collectively, "Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII")
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, Dine Chat may collect information regarding users' past orders, favorite venues, customer service
        inquiries, service reviews, and certain preferences related to social networking (e.g., pages you "Like" or
        "Recommend").
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also use web analytics software to track and analyze traffic in connection with Dine Chat advertising and
        promotion of services. We may publish these statistics or share them with third parties without including PII.
    </p>
    <p>
        Non-Personally Identifiable Information (or "Non-PII") is aggregated information, demographic information, and
        any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. We and our third-party service providers may
        collect Non-PII, including your MAC address, computer type, screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and
        demographic data like location, gender, and date of birth. We and our service providers may use cookies, pixel
        tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies to serve you with tailored information and facilitate your
        ongoing use of our Application. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, most
        browsers allow you to decline the use of cookies
    </p>
    <p>
        IP Addresses are automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). We log IP
        Addresses along with visit times and pages visited for site usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and
        administering the site.
    </p>
    <h2>Use of Your Informatio</h2>
    <p>
        Dine Chat uses PII to create user accounts, communicate about services, offer additional services, promotions,
        special offers, and charge for purchases. Users can opt-out of receiving promotional communications. We enforce
        our terms of use and service through the use of PII.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use cookies for site recognition and enhancing user experience. We do not sell the information we collect to
        third parties. However, we share collected PII with third-party vendors and service providers for APIs and
        functions related to service delivery. We also disclose PII to restaurants for order processing and may disclose
        it to legal authorities in connection with law enforcement requests or legal claims.
    </p>
    <h2>

        for as long as it remains combined.
    </p>

    </h2>

        required to do otherwise under applicable law.
